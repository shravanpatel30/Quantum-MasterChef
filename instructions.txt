How to play the game:
- On the right side you are given the initial ingredient (initial statevector) and the final dish (target statevector).
- Your goal as a Quantum Chef is to prepare a quantum recipie (quantum circuit) that will use the initial ingredient to prepare the final dish.
- Below is an example of how you can prepare a recipie:

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.initialize(Statevector.from_label('11'))
qc.x([0,1])
qc.draw('mpl')

-After you have a trial recipie (circuit), press the 'Simulate' button first. This will show you how your circuit looks and the final statevector that is prepared using your recipie.
-Once you have simulated your recipie, you can go ahead and press the 'Check' button to compare your final statevector with the given final statevector.

Important points to remember:
-Only use .draw('mpl') at the end of your quantum circuit so that the game displays your quantum circuit without problems.
-Make sure you use only .initialize() method to initialize your circuit (this is the best way to initialize the circuit).
